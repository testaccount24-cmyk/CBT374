//***FILE 374 is from David Marsden of Perth, Australia, and        *   FILE 374
//*           contains a collection of SAS programs to read and     *   FILE 374
//*           interpret SMF records.  File 374 contains programs    *   FILE 374
//*           to look at IBM-produced SMF records.  File 375 adds   *   FILE 374
//*           some programs to look at vendor-produced SMF records  *   FILE 374
//*           (Huron and ObjectSTAR).                               *   FILE 374

//*     This file contains:                                         *   FILE 374
//*                                                                 *   FILE 374
//*     SAS programs to read SMF mainly.                            *   FILE 374
//*                                                                 *   FILE 374
//*     Useful if you don't have MXG and want to do your own.       *   FILE 374
//*     You need the IBM SMF manual to understand what is being     *   FILE 374
//*     read. If you cannot locate a copy there are versions on     *   FILE 374
//*     the web you can freely access.                              *   FILE 374
//*                                                                 *   FILE 374
//*     The technique of using the triplets (offset, length,        *   FILE 374
//*     number) to get repeating data has caused much grief to      *   FILE 374
//*     those who want to read SMF using COBOL etc.                 *   FILE 374
//*                                                                 *   FILE 374
//*     Many of these were written years ago and may require        *   FILE 374
//*     some work to get them up to date - but SMF is generally     *   FILE 374
//*     upward compatible.  Thus they are most likely to be         *   FILE 374
//*     wrong in so far as they miss the stuff that has been        *   FILE 374
//*     added at the end or in the gaps that are sometimes left.    *   FILE 374
//*                                                                 *   FILE 374
//*     In addition, there are:                                     *   FILE 374
//*                                                                 *   FILE 374
//*     Some other non-SMF jobs, using code as supplied by SAS      *   FILE 374
//*     as examples to read disk VTOCs, PDS directories.            *   FILE 374
//*                                                                 *   FILE 374
